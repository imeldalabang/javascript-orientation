    <h1>MINIBIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <h2>PROFILE AND SKILLS</h2>


    <p>My name is Imelda Labang Donchi Ep Kemezeu. I come from Cameroon.I am 25 years old.I live in UNITED
        STATES OF AMERICA and I am a student at Dallas College.
        In 2023,I have decided to switch in IT world to achieve my goals,and become a successful WEB
        DEVELOPER. I also love cooking and dancing and I speak

    <h2> MEDICAL BACKGROUND </h2>
    <p>
        I have a diverse skill set and a passion for continuous learning. With a solid foundation in the
        medical field, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. However, my journey doesn't
        stop there. In pursuit of new challenges and opportunities, I have embarked on a journey into the world
        of
        web
        development.Combining the precision and analytical mindset honed in the medical arena with the
        creativity
        and
        problem-solving
        skills required in web development, I am carving a unique path. The transition from medicine to web
        development showcases my adaptability and eagerness to embrace change.
    </p>

    <p>As I navigate the complexities of coding languages, design principles, and development frameworks, I am
        not
        just
        learning to code but creating a bridge between the healthcare and tech domains. Their
        commitment to growth and versatility is evident in this exciting fusion of two seemingly disparate
        fields.You
        can
        find someone with a rich background, a commitment to lifelong learning, and the ability to
        thrive in diverse and challenging environments. Whether diagnosing medical conditions or troubleshooting
        code, I
        bring a unique perspective and a dedication to excellence.
    </p>

    <h2> MY JOURNEY IN IT</h2>
    <p> Last semesters,(FALL 2023 and SPRING 2024) I took some classes like WEB DESIGN TOOLS course, WEB AUTHORING
        course, INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON, DIGITAL IMAGING 1... In some courses like web design ,we used the Visual studio code to write
        our
        html
        code and
        Filezilla to display our page on the server of the school.We used a Git repository for
        our projet files.We also used the W3 validator service,the W3 css-validator and, the wave accessibility
        checker to test and debug the html ,css code and web page.</p>
    <p>We used a W3 css-library and css-style to implement the design of the pages
        (tables,form,color,margin,padding,icons,list...)In this class I have learned how to create a web page,
        to
        design
        it
        for user-friendly, and some
        other stuff.These will help me to make my first step in the web world. The professor was so explicit and
        availablefor the questions.</p>

    <h2>GOALS</h2>

    <p>After taking some foundational web classes, I am currently enrolled in this intermediate web programming course
        for this semester(FALL 2024).
        I am taking this class because is one of the classes that I have to take to succeed in my journey, and I am also
        happy to learn new things. I hope This class will
        help me deepen my understanding of web technologies and improving my coding skills. I really want to learn
        how to build
        more
        dynamic and interactive websites, working with languages like JavaScript and exploring various web development
        frameworks. This experience will enhance my ability to create robust, user-friendly websites.I hope we will have a great
        semester.!!!</p>
